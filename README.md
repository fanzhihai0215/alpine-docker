# Alpine with Docker

Alpine Linux with Docker preinstalled, or even better Docker-in-Docker (dind)

### What is Docker in Docker?
Although running Docker inside Docker is generally not recommended, there are some legitimate use cases, such as development of Docker itself.

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

Main use reason for this image is for gitlab runner builds.
